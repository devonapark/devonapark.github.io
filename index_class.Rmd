You can do everything you might usually do.


..like add text:


This website is an example coming from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html). We're making websites today.

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton for data science.

How to link from the index page to the about page:

Learn more about this site [here](about.html).
For this to work, all of your pages need to be in the same folder. 


Here are some [plots](plots.html).


To show that you can use RMD like normal, check out this page with [plots](plots.html).


Include a picture!

If I want to ge fonts, they come from this [place](https://fontawesome.com/).

I can change icons from that site link as well. 

I can copy what is going on in our p8105 website by going to the github and getting it from that _site.yml 


Here's a plot. This seems to show:
$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_11 x_i + \epsilon$$


This will always be the homepage. I can make other repositories and make them websites and it will be https://devonapark.github.io/NEW_REPO_NAME.
